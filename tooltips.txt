incoming_mail_folder = The name of the folder in the mailbox for searching for incoming email commands
processed_mail_folder = Once an email command has been processed by the software the email is moved to this mailbox folder
server_port = The TCP port used for by genmon for communicating with the other apps.
address = The Modbus slave address. This *should* not need to be changed from 9d.
loglocation = location of log files
enabledebug = Enable code to support reverse engineering of registers. This option, when enabled creates a thread that will monitor registers in the controller and send notifications of changed registers. Not used in normal operation.
displayunknown = Display the contents of additional registers that appear to be associated with sensors of some type.
uselegacysetexercise = Enable using and alternate method for writing the exercise time. Not used in normal operation. The software will auto-detect when this needs to be enabled but this setting overrides the auto-detect.
disableoutagecheck = Disable the monitoring of the utility line voltage for detecting power outages. If you have a 'smart' transfer switch, this may need to be enabled.
liquidcooled = The software will auto-detect the cooling type. The auto-detect can be overridden with this setting. Enable for liquid cooled, disable or air cooled.
evolutioncontroller = The software will auto-detect the controller type. The auto-detect can be overridden with this setting. Enable for Evolution controller, disable for Nexus Controller.
petroleumfuel = Only valid for liquid cooled Evolution generators. Enable if your generator uses diesel or gasoline, disable if you use propane or natural gas. This value is used to change how status relays are displayed.
outagelog = Full path and file name of the power outage log.f
syncdst = Enable to sync the generator time to the system time if there is a change in Daylight Savings Time. This does not change the system time, only the generator time.
synctime = Enables syncing the generator time to the system time once every hour. This does not change the system time, only the generator time.
enhancedexercise = Enable the functionality to support biweekly and monthly exercise times (weekly is the default). Note, your generator controller must support this before enabling this option.
usehttps = HTTPS (secure HTTP) and / or user name and password authentication.
useselfsignedcert = 'Use Secure Web Settings' must be enabled to use this feature.  Enables using a self signed certificate for secure web transactions.
keyfile = If Use 'Self-signed Certificate' is disabled, denotes the path and filename of the key file
certfile = If Use 'Self-signed Certificate' is disabled, denotes the path and filename of the cert file
http_user = Simple authentication will be used. Sets the username of the simple authentication. Leave blank to disable. 'Use Secure Web Settings' must be enabled to use this feature.
http_pass = Simple authentication will be used. Sets the password of the simple authentication. Leave blank to disable. 'Use Secure Web Settings' must be enabled to use this feature.
http_user_ro = Sets the username of the limited rights user. Leave blank to disable. 'Use Secure Web Settings' and full rights user must be enabled to use this feature.
http_pass_ro = Sets the password of the limited rights user. Leave blank to disable. 'Use Secure Web Settings' and full rights user must be enabled to use this feature.
http_port = HTTP port to be used by the web server.
favicon = favicon for website. This is an optional parameter and default is "favicon.ico". This may not work in older browsers
kwlogmax = Full path to override the default kW log. If this option is present but empty the kW log will be disabled.
kwlog = Override the maximum size of the kW log. The default is 15MB.
currentdivider = This is a value to override the divisor used to calculate the current for Evolution Air Cooled units. This value is expressed in floating point.
currentoffset = This value provides an offset to compensate for mis-calibrated current transformers in Evolution Air Cooled generators. This may need to be used if you you see a negative current value displayed for Evolution Air Cooled Generators. The default value is zero.
disableplatformstats = If enabled, platform statistics will not be displayed in the user interface
disableweather= Disable weather feature
weatherkey = Openweathermap.org API Key. This is required to enable weather reporting. See https://openweathermap.org/appid. Requires openweathermap library. If you installed the Generator Monitor Software before V1.9.6 and are upgrading you must run this command: "sudo pip install pyowm" from the console before the weather features will be functional
weatherlocation = The location to report weather. Either enter City,State,Country or a openweathermap.org city ID.
metricweather = If enabled, metric units will be used to display weather or platform information
minimumweatherinfo = If enabled the minimum information regarding the weather will be displayed, otherwise the maximum info will be displayed
readonlyemailcommands= If enabled, email commands that write to the controller will be disabled (settime, setexercise, setremote, etc.)
nominalfrequency = Frequency your generator is running. Either 50Hz or 60Hz. This is used by the web interface.
nominalRPM = The RPM of your generator. Typically 1800 or 3600 for 60Hz and 1500 or 3000 for 50Hz. Some models run at 2300. This is used by the web interface.
nominalKW = The maximum kilowatt output of your generator. This is used by the web interface.
fueltype = The type of fuel used by your generator (Natural Gas, Propane, Diesel, Gasoline). This value is used by for displaying the correct information to the user.
model = The model of your generator as detected by the software
voltageconfiguration = The voltage configuration of the industrial generator.
nominalbattery = 12 for one battery, 24 for two batteries
controllertype = Set to h_100 for H-100 mode, otherwise the software will default to Nexus/Evolution Mode
autofeedback = If enabled, an email will be sent to the software maintainer if critical data is missing in the software for your generator. The email will contain the contents of the generator registers. Enabling this option helps support the widest possible set of features and supported generators.
