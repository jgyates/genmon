# (optional) This option enables (when True) using and alternate method for writing
# the exercise time. Some version of the Evolution firmware only support the legacy
# method of writing the exercise time. The legacy method is a bit more convoluted
# and the current implementation may result in the exercise time being off by one
# or two minutes from the request set value. (optional, default False).  Note
# this option is forced True if a Nexus controller is detected or selected.

# method the exercise time must be at least three minutes or more from the current
# generator time.

# (optional) Disable the monitoring of the utility line voltage for detecting
# power outages. This will disable the sending of emails when a power outage is
# detected. If you have a Transfer Switch that monitors the utility line and starts
# your generator you may need to set this to true. Most transfer switches requires
# the generator controller to monitor the utility line voltage and notify the switch
# to activate so in most cases this will not be needed. If you software is reading

# (optional). The software will auto-detect the controller type. The auto-detect
# can be overridden with this setting. True for Evolution controller, False for
# Nexus Controller.
#evolutioncontroller = True

# (optional). This parameter will specify the full path of a file that will log
# power outages. An outage is defined by the utility voltage dropping below the
# generator's programmed threshold voltage. Typically the generator has a hold
# off period (usually around 5 seconds) before the generator starts. If utility
# power is rises above the threshold voltage before the hold off timer has
# expired the generator will  not start, but the outage will still be logged.
# If this parameter is not present the outage log will be in the same directory
# as genmon.py. To reset the outage log manually delete the outage.txt file.
