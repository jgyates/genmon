## V1.11.6 - 2018-10-13
- Changed loading method in genloader.py to work around I/O error with Flask library. As a result the output of the flask library is redirected to /dev/null so it will not be displayed on the console. If you started the software manually from the console and then exited the console and attempted to restart from the web UI (with a settings change) the Flask library used by genserv.py would cause an exception (I/O error). This works around this issue.
