kwlogmax = Override the maximum size of the kW log. The default is 15MB.
kwlog = Full path to override the default kW log. If this option is present but empty the kW log will be disabled.
currentdivider = This is a value to override the divisor used to calculate the current for Evolution units. This value is expressed in floating point. Leave blank to use the default value.
currentoffset = This value provides an offset to compensate for mis-calibrated current transformers in Evolution generators. This may need to be used if you you see a negative current value displayed for Evolution Air Cooled Generators. The default value is zero. Leave blank to use the default value.
disableplatformstats = If enabled, platform statistics will not be displayed in the user interface
optimizeforslowercpu = If enabled, minor optimizations for slower CPUs will be used. Note that this is a design trade off for responsiveness vs CPU utilization.
disableweather= Disable weather feature
weatherkey = Openweathermap.org API Key. This is required to enable weather reporting. See https://openweathermap.org/appid. Requires openweathermap library. If you installed the Generator Monitor Software before V1.9.6 and are upgrading you must run this command: "sudo pip install pyowm" from the console before the weather features will be functional

model = The model of your generator as detected by the software
voltageconfiguration = The voltage configuration of the industrial generator.
nominalbattery = 12 for one battery, 24 for two batteries
controllertype = Set to h_100 for H-100 mode, otherwise the software will default to Nexus/Evolution Mode
autofeedback = If enabled, an email will be sent to the software maintainer if critical data is missing in the software for your generator. The email will contain the contents of the generator registers. Enabling this option helps support the widest possible set of features and supported generators.
use_serial_tcp = If enabled, the software will use TCP over serial instead of direct serial communications
serial_tcp_address = If Serial over TCP/IP is enabled, this parameter sets the IP address used for the serial server.
serial_tcp_port = If Serial over TCP/IP is enabled, this parameter sets the IP port used for the serial server.
hts_transfer_switch=Enable if you have a HTS, MTS or STS transfer switch to enable reading additional data from the transfer switch
smart_transfer_switch = If enabled a smart transfer switch is utilized and the generator controller will not be responsible for starting and stopping or or weekly exercise functions and these items will be disabled in the web interface.
serialnumberifmissing= If the serial number is not present due to the controller being replaced you can override the missing serial number and still have the software lookup model information. This is a numeric value that must be ten digits. Pad leading zeros if you serial number is less than 10 digits.
additionalrunhours= Nexus controllers (not Evolution) do not have the ability to set the run hours. If your controller has been replaced you can use this entry to add hours to the Run Hours reported by the in the UI. Note: If this option is used it will only modify the run hours displayed in the web interface. It will not affect the controllers internal maintenance counters. This value must be a numeric value.
additional_modbus_timeout=Add this value (in seconds) to the modbus timeout value. Floating point value.
disablepowerlog=Enable to disable the power log and current reading. Not supported on Nexus.
subtractfuel=The amount of fuel (gal or L, depending on 'Use Metric' setting) to subtract from the fuel in tank estimate
user_url=A user defined URL link to include in status emails sent from the software when the generator status changes
usenominallinevolts = Enable overriding of the default of 240V for nominal line voltage in the UI
nominallinevolts = Override nominal line voltage value for UI (i.e. 220, 230 in stead of 240)
