hts_transfer_switch=Enable if you have a HTS, MTS or STS transfer switch to enable reading additional data from the transfer switch
smart_transfer_switch = If enabled a smart transfer switch is utilized and the generator controller will not be responsible for starting and stopping or or weekly exercise functions and these items will be disabled in the web interface.
serialnumberifmissing= If the serial number is not present due to the controller being replaced you can override the missing serial number and still have the software lookup model information. This is a numeric value that must be ten digits. Pad leading zeros if you serial number is less than 10 digits.
additionalrunhours= Nexus controllers (not Evolution) do not have the ability to set the run hours. If your controller has been replaced you can use this entry to add hours to the Run Hours reported by the in the UI. Note: If this option is used it will only modify the run hours displayed in the web interface. It will not affect the controllers internal maintenance counters. This value must be a numeric value.

If the login failures occur within the time frame of lockout duration then then logins will be blocked for the number of seconds of lockout duration. Set to zero to disable.
login_lockout_seconds=The number of seconds to perform a lockout if failed logins exceed Maximum Login Attempts. For example if this value is 300 seconds (5 min) and max attempt is 5, then if 5 logins failures occur in a row within 5 minutes, the a lockout will occur for 5 minutes.
serial_parity=The default for Generac is None. Some (Briggs and Stratton uses Odd) custom controllers may use Odd or Even parity. Note: this is only for direct serial, not for serial over TCP.
serial_rate=The rate of the serial link used to communicate with the controller. In almost all cases this is 9600. Evolution 4.5L models may use 115200 for this value.
forceserialuse=If enabled, the software will try continue attempt use the serial port even if it is not found when the software is initially loaded. This may be needed for some serial USB devices.
unbalanced_capacity=Disabled if zero. If non zero this will be the maximum allowable difference in the load on a generator leg, represented as a percent of the maximum load. A value of 0.50 (50%) would be an allowable difference of 100 amps between legs on a 200 amp rated generator. Lower values will be the most strict threshold. Higher values will be less strict. Valid values are 0 - 0.50. Unbalanced capacity notices are set via a warning email, once per day.
