# ==============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: Home Assistant MQTT Discovery Prerequisites
# ==============================================================================
# This addon uses MQTT Discovery to automatically create entities and publish
# values in Home Assistant. For this to work, you MUST have MQTT Discovery enabled in your
# Home Assistant MQTT integration.
#
# Required Home Assistant Setup:
# 1. MQTT integration must be installed and configured
# 2. MQTT Discovery must be ENABLED (Settings -> Devices & Services -> MQTT -> Configure)
# 3. Discovery prefix must match the 'discovery_prefix' setting below (default: "homeassistant")
#
# If entities are not appearing in Home Assistant:
# - Verify MQTT Discovery is enabled in HA: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery
# - Check that discovery prefix matches: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#configure-mqtt-options
# - The default prefix is "homeassistant" - only change if you customized it in HA
#
# Note: This addon is DIFFERENT from genmqtt.py. This addon publishes discovery
# messages so Home Assistant automatically creates entities. You do NOT need to
# manually configure MQTT sensors in Home Assistant.
# ==============================================================================

# Required. Address of MQTT Broker server. This value should be changed to match
# the IP address of your MQTT server.
mqtt_address = 192.168.1.20

# Optional. This value is used if your MQTT server requires authentication.
# This is the username.
username =

# Optional. This value is used if your MQTT server requires authentication.
# This is the password.
password =

# Optional. This value is the IP address of the system running the generator
# monitor software. If the program is running on the same system as genmon,
# then this parameter is not needed.
monitor_address =

# Optional. This parameter is the port of the MQTT server in a decimal number.
# If this value is not present then 1883 is the default.
mqtt_port = 1883

# CRITICAL: Home Assistant MQTT discovery prefix. Default is "homeassistant".
# This MUST match the discovery prefix configured in your Home Assistant MQTT
# integration. If these don't match, entities will NOT appear in Home Assistant.
# To check/change in HA: Settings -> Devices & Services -> MQTT -> Configure
# See: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#configure-mqtt-options
discovery_prefix = homeassistant

# Optional. Base topic for state and command messages. Default is "genmon".
# State topics will be: {base_topic}/sensor/{entity_id}/state
# Command topics will be: {base_topic}/button/{entity_id}/command
base_topic = genmon

# Optional. Unique device identifier. Used to create unique entity IDs in Home
# Assistant. Change this if you have multiple genmon instances.
device_id = generator

# Optional. Friendly device name shown in Home Assistant.
device_name = Generator

# Optional. Poll interval is the time between requesting status from genmon.
# The default value is 3 seconds.
poll_interval = 3

# Optional. Interval in seconds to republish discovery messages. This ensures
# Home Assistant rediscovers entities if it restarts. Set to 0 to only publish
# on startup and reconnect. Default is 300 (5 minutes).
discovery_interval = 300

# Optional. Full path to Certificate Authority file. Leave empty to not
# use SSL/TLS. If used the port will be forced to 8883.
cert_authority_path =

# Optional. TLS version. Must be 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2. Default is 1.2.
tls_version = 1.2

# Optional. Certificate requirements: None, Optional, or Required.
cert_reqs = Required

# Optional. Full path to the client certificate file for MTLS.
client_cert_path =

# Optional. Full path to the client key file for MTLS.
client_key_path =

# Optional. Entity blacklist. Comma-separated list of strings. Entities with
# names containing any of these strings will not be created.
# Example: blacklist = Packet Count, Platform Stats, CRC Errors
blacklist =

# Optional. Include platform/monitor statistics entities (CPU, memory, etc.)
include_monitor_stats = True

# Optional. Include weather data entities if weather is configured in genmon.
include_weather = True

# Optional. Include log entries as sensor attributes.
include_logs = False

# Optional. Use numeric JSON format when querying genmon. This provides cleaner
# numeric values without units embedded in strings.
numeric_json = True

# Optional. Enable debug logging.
debug = True

# Optional. Unique MQTT client identifier.
client_id = genmon_ha
